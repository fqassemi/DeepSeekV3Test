# DeepSeekV3Test
This is a simple repo to use newly released deepseek v3 
Recently, deepseek v3 is relased which has high quality with low price. One can find the API here: https://platform.deepseek.com/. However, the API documentation is not complete. The goal of this simple python file is to create a boilerplate to use and test the API for those who might be interested.
